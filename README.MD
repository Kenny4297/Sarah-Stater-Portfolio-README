## **Project Overview**
I was contacted by Sarah Sater, a social worker seeking promotion. She wished for a more impactful alternative to a standard resume to stand out among other candidates. Upon securing the new role, she intends to add features to her professional profile, including a 'contact me' section and a resume download option.

## **Inspiration**
Having built multiple portfolios for clients in the past, I wanted to learn a new framework. I had heard great things about Tailwind, and decided to implement it in this current project.

## **Unique Technologies**
**Tailwind**

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of low-level, single-purpose CSS classes that can be used to style web pages. This makes it easy to quickly and easily create custom designs without having to write a lot of custom CSS.
